# Zero-Shot OS — All-in-One PPP (Single Source of Truth)

## Status

- **Canonical Source:** This file is the sole source of truth for planning, execution, and verification.
- **Use For:** Planning, execution, and verification. All task lists must roll up here.

- **Versioning:** This document is versioned via Git history. The filename stays stable; major milestones are recorded in the changelog below.

### Changelog

- **v1.1.0 (2025-12-20):** Added Zero-Shot Buildability Contract (ZSBC) to make the PPP machine-executable and externally verifiable.

---

## Policy Summary (Non-Negotiable)

- **Canonical Source:** This PPP is the single source of truth for planning, execution, and verification.
- **Runtime Boundary (ZSB-RB-01):** Node.js + TypeScript only for the zero-shot minimum. Python is not allowed in the zero-shot qualification path.
- **Zero-Shot Minimum:** One full playable regime + corpus export + all ZSBC checks pass.
- **Prompt Governance:** JSON is canonical; Markdown is generated and must be reproducible.
- **ZSBC Enforcement:** No human intervention after start; immutable evidence bundle required.
- **Secrets Handling:** Explicit env requirements and deterministic redaction.

---

## Part 0 — System Definition + Brain-First Principle (Required Reading)

### 0.1 Naming (Single Source of Truth)

**System Name:** Zero-Shot OS

**The Zero-Shot OS has two parts:**

1. **UPOS7VS Core (Open Source, platform/framework agnostic)**

   - Purpose: prompt-engineering engine that standardizes intent (UPOS7VS), routes work across models/tools, and produces deterministic artifacts.

2. **Zero Shot Build + Governance System (Enterprise, paid)**

   - Purpose: enforces end-to-end SDLC governance (ideation → planning → implementation → review → release → production monitoring) and makes compliance/auditability non-optional.

**Necessary overlap (explicit and intentional):**

- Shared schemas for governance artifacts.
- Shared vocabulary (IDs, naming, status states) so the OSS Core can safely interoperate with the Enterprise system.

### 0.2 The Zero Shot Brain (KB) is the Central Hub

The **Zero Shot Brain** is the starting point for all work. It is the authoritative hub that stores and indexes:

- approved reusable components (the fastest path to zero-shot development)
- rules/policies and their enforcement boundaries
- golden-path workflows (the “how we ship” playbooks)
- troubleshooting guides and known failure modes
- decision logs and rationale (why the rules exist)
- provenance links: component → usage → incidents → remediations

**Brain-first rule:** no developer or agent begins a new feature by designing from scratch. The first action is always:

1) check the Brain inventory for an approved component and its docs
2) reuse it if it exists
3) if it does not exist, propose it through governed creation so it becomes reusable next time

### 0.6 Deterministic Brain Inventory (File/Folder Contract)

### 0.6.1 Per-Repo Component Inventory (Bootstrap)

Each repo maintains a minimal, machine-readable component registry to keep modules swappable and dependency-graphable.

**Canonical file (per repo):** `components.json`

**Schema (per repo):** `COMPONENTS.schema.json`

**Lite install:** `INSTALL_COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md`

**Rule:** Keep this file small and current; no scripts required for initial install. Aggregation happens later via a separate module.

The Brain must be **a deterministic folder tree** that can be mounted locally and validated in CI.

**Canonical Brain root (repo-relative path):**

- `zero-shot/brain/`

**Minimum required Brain subfolders:**

- `zero-shot/brain/components/` — approved reusable components (each component is a folder)
- `zero-shot/brain/components/_index.json` — component registry index (machine-readable)
- `zero-shot/brain/policies/` — policy packs (JSON) + human-readable explanations (MD)
- `zero-shot/brain/golden-paths/` — step-by-step workflows (MD + diagrams)
- `zero-shot/brain/troubleshooting/` — known issues + fixes (MD)
- `zero-shot/brain/decisions/` — decision logs (MD/JSON) with references
- `zero-shot/brain/schemas/` — JSON Schemas used by governance gates

**Brain component folder contract (example):**

- `zero-shot/brain/components/<component-slug>/README.md` — purpose + usage + examples
- `zero-shot/brain/components/<component-slug>/component.json` — machine-readable metadata
- `zero-shot/brain/components/<component-slug>/tests/` — validation tests or test instructions
- `zero-shot/brain/components/<component-slug>/troubleshooting.md` — common failures + fixes

**Non-negotiable property:** The Brain is the first stop. Reuse is the default. New creation is governed.

---

### 0.7 Zero-Shot Buildability Contract (ZSBC)

This contract defines when the PPP is **machine-executable** (agent-runner buildable) with **no human intervention after start** and **publishable verification artifacts**.

#### ZSBC-0 Definitions

A **Run** is a single execution of the system’s Task Graph from a clean checkout.

A Run is **Zero-Shot Buildable** only if:

1. it completes in CI with **no human intervention after start**
2. it produces an **immutable evidence bundle** sufficient for independent verification
3. every requirement in ZSBC-1 through ZSBC-9 passes

---

### 0.8 Zero-Shot Minimums + Governance Sources of Truth

**Runtime boundary (zero-shot target):**

- **Default:** Node.js + TypeScript only.
- **Python is optional** and only allowed if explicitly scoped in the TaskGraph with a strict I/O contract and evidence bundle.
- If Python is introduced, it must be confined to **one of these responsibilities** and nothing else:
  - **Offline evaluation engines** (e.g., scoring, grading, statistical analysis).
  - **Optional analytics post-processing** that consumes only exported artifacts.
  - **Experimental ML utilities** that do not block the core build.

**Runtime Boundary Rule (ZSB-RB-01):** The production and dev runtime for the zero-shot minimum is Node.js + TypeScript only. **No Python services are permitted in the zero-shot qualification path.** Any future Python use must be implemented as offline tooling (non-required for bootstrap/run/tests) unless a new explicit contract version elevates it.

**Python boundary checklist (if used):**

- **Non-blocking:** The core build must succeed without Python.
- **Contracted I/O:** JSON in → JSON out, with schema validation.
- **Deterministic artifacts:** Outputs are versioned and reproducible.
- **No secrets in logs:** Explicit redaction in stdout/stderr.
- **TaskGraph declared:** Step includes inputs, outputs, acceptance, and evidence.
- **Isolation:** No direct modification of core runtime state.

**Minimum zero-shot core feature set (to qualify as zero-shot):**

- **One full playable regime** that executes end-to-end.
- **Corpus export** produced as an immutable artifact.
- All ZSBC checks pass (no human intervention, verifiable evidence).

**Prompt governance source of truth (non-negotiable):**

- **JSON is canonical.**
- **Markdown is a generated view** for readability.
- Drift is disallowed: generated Markdown must be reproducible from JSON.

#### ZSBC-1 No Human Intervention Policy (Hard Constraint)

- No interactive prompts. All commands must be non-interactive.
- No manual edits, approvals, or mid-run decisions.
- Any interaction attempt triggers **fail-fast abort** with an attestation record.

**Abort attestation must include:** step id, reason code, timestamp, and last lines of redacted stdout/stderr.

#### ZSBC-2 Machine-Executable Task Graph (TaskGraph.yaml)

**Required file:**

- `zero-shot/brain/golden-paths/TaskGraph.yaml`

**Every step must declare (no omissions):**

- `id` (stable unique)
- `intent` (1 sentence)
- `working_dir`
- `inputs`
- `outputs` (paths + expected hash/regex)
- `commands` (exact, non-interactive)
- `acceptance` (PASS/FAIL checks)
- `depends_on`
- `rollback` (exact, non-interactive)
- `evidence` (what to collect)
- `resources` (budgets)
- `parallel` (parallelism rules)
- `secrets` (required env vars + validation + redaction)
- `retry` (bounded)
- `fallback` (bounded)

**Resource budgets are mandatory per step:**

- `max_seconds`
- `max_retries_total`
- `max_cost_usd` (if LLM calls possible)
- `max_tokens` (if LLM calls possible)

#### ZSBC-3 Secrets Handling (Explicit + Validated + Redacted)

- Secrets must be declared under `secrets.required_env` per step.
- Runner must fail-fast on missing or malformed secrets.
- Runner must redact secrets from logs and artifacts deterministically (regex-based).

#### ZSBC-4 Deterministic Environment + Reproducible Builds

- Container/devcontainer required with pinned image digest.
- Toolchains pinned and verified in preflight.
- Lockfile integrity is hash-verified before install.
- Reproducible build flag set (e.g., `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`) and recorded in evidence.
- Build outputs are hashed and included in a manifest.

#### ZSBC-5 Runner MVP Spec (Required for Credibility)

**Runner command (minimum viable):**

- `npm run zero-shot:run -- --graph zero-shot/brain/golden-paths/TaskGraph.yaml`

**Runner outputs (mandatory):**

- `zero-shot/runs/<runId>/run.json`
- `zero-shot/runs/<runId>/timeline.md`
- `zero-shot/runs/<runId>/manifest.sha256`
- `zero-shot/runs/<runId>/steps/<stepId>/stdout.log`
- `zero-shot/runs/<runId>/steps/<stepId>/stderr.log`
- `zero-shot/runs/<runId>/steps/<stepId>/result.json`

**Runner exit codes (mandatory):**

- `0` success (all acceptance gates passed)
- `10` TaskGraph schema invalid
- `20` preflight failed (secrets/toolchain/lockfile)
- `30` acceptance gate failed
- `40` budget exceeded
- `50` interaction detected (violates zero-shot)
- `60` retries exhausted
- `70` fallback failed

#### ZSBC-6 Acceptance Gates (Deterministic PASS/FAIL)

- Every step must include deterministic acceptance checks (exit codes + regex/hash/file existence).
- Gate failures are terminal (no manual override).
- Final release gate includes tests, build, governance check, secret scan, and manifest generation.

#### ZSBC-7 Zero-Shot Recovery Policy (Bounded + Encoded)

- Retries are bounded per step with deterministic backoff.
- Retry only on declared error classes (exit codes/regex patterns).
- Fallback is encoded in TaskGraph (alternate command/model/provider) and is also bounded.
- Fallback does not weaken acceptance gates.

#### ZSBC-8 Brain Inventory Enforcement (Reuse is Mandatory)

- Brain registry (`zero-shot/brain/components/_index.json`) must be schema-validated.
- TaskGraph must include a **ReuseCheck** step before any new component creation.
- ReuseCheck output is stored in the run evidence bundle and is required for PASS.

#### ZSBC-9 Public Claim Readiness (External Verification Artifacts)

- CI must publish `zero-shot/runs/<runId>/` as a downloadable artifact.
- CI logs for the run job must be externally reviewable.
- `manifest.sha256` must include hashes for TaskGraph, runner version, container digest, lockfiles, key build outputs, and run bundle.
- A “one-shot build” claim is allowed only when CI succeeded from a clean checkout with no manual edits/reruns and the evidence bundle + manifest are published.

## Prompt (Intent / UPOS-7-VS)

### Role / Persona

**AI Platform Architect** building governance infrastructure for multi-model LLM applications requiring:

- Neurodivergent-accessible UX (ADHD, autism, dyslexia friendly)
- Deterministic execution (every step verifiable)
- Privacy-first local operation
- Enterprise compliance readiness

### Objective

Create a complete governance and build operating system that makes AI projects:

1. **Reproducible** - Same inputs → same outputs, zero configuration drift
2. **Explainable** - Every decision logged and auditable
3. **Compliant** - SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA ready with artifact enforcement
4. **Neurodivergent-first** - Visual workflows, step-by-step guides, binary verification

#### Scenario / Context

Applied AI teams face:

- Config drift causing production incidents
- No audit trail for model/architecture decisions
- Secrets leakage from copy-paste workflows
- Stale documentation (handoffs, diagrams, profiles)
- Vendor lock-in to single LLM providers
- High cognitive load for neurodivergent developers

#### Task

Build Zero-Shot-Build-OS combining:

#### Component 0: Zero Shot Brain (Knowledge Base + Component Inventory)

- Component registry (approved reusable building blocks)
- Golden paths (deterministic workflows)
- Troubleshooting/runbooks (fast recovery)
- Policy packs + decision logs (why rules exist)
- Provenance (component usage and incident feedback)

#### Component 1: UPOS7VS (Orchestrator)

- Multi-provider prompt routing (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Watson, Google)
- Local analytics and cost tracking
- Semantic mode detection
- Privacy-first PII scrubbing

#### Component 2: LLM Council (Governance)

- Multi-model voting system (3-7 models)
- Weighted consensus (unanimous, supermajority, majority thresholds)
- Chairman synthesis of final decisions
- Decision audit trail

#### Component 3: Petris (Visual Builder)

- Step-by-step workflow visualization
- Progress tracking with verification criteria
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Screen reader optimized

#### Component 4: CI/CD Gates

- Artifact freshness enforcement (HANDOFF.md, openmemory.md, USER_PROFILE.md, ARCHITECTURE.mermaid)
- JSON schema validation for all artifacts
- Secret scanning
- Health check automation

#### Format

Deliver:

1. **Working codebase** - TypeScript monorepo with 95%+ test coverage
2. **API layer** - Fastify server exposing governance endpoints

- 30-day timeline to first paying customer
- No vendor lock-in (works with any LLM)

#### Verification Criteria

**Must Pass All:**

1. **Governance Check Passes**

   ```bash
   set -euo pipefail

   npm run governance:check
   # Exit code: 0
   # All 4 artifacts present and schema-validated
   ```

2. **API Server Functional**

   ```bash
   set -euo pipefail

   npm run governance:api
   # Server starts on port 3001
   # All endpoints return 200/201 for valid requests
   ```

3. **Schema Validation Works**

   ```bash
   set -euo pipefail

   # Valid data returns {"valid": true}
   # Invalid data returns {"valid": false, "errors": [...]}
   ```

4. **Tests Pass**

   ```bash
   set -euo pipefail

   npm test
   # All tests pass
   # Coverage ≥ 85% for new code
   ```

5. **TypeScript Compiles**

   ```bash
   set -euo pipefail

   npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json
   ```

6. **No Secrets Detected**

   ```bash
   set -euo pipefail

   npm run governance:scan-secrets
   # Exit code: 0
   ```

## Inputs/Snippets/Links

**Existing Assets:**

- `${REPO_ROOT}` - UPOS7VS core (95% test coverage, production-ready)
- `${COUNCIL_ROOT}` - LLM Council (80% complete, functional standalone)

**User Decisions (From Questions):**

- Packaging: Open Source Core + Commercial Enterprise
- Revenue target: 30 days (speed priority)
- Council: Multi-model voting (recommended)
- Interface: Visual step-by-step builder (recommended)

### Assumptions

1. User has Node.js 18+ and npm installed
2. User has at least one LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local Ollama)
3. User can create and access a private product repository (public OSS mirror optional, requires explicit approval)
4. User has email access for enterprise lead capture
5. Market exists for governance-first AI tooling at $299/month enterprise tier

---

## Plan (Decisions / REASONS Log)

### Reflect: Intent Confirmed? Gaps?

**Intent Confirmed:**

- ✅ Need for governance and reproducibility validated by CODEX feedback
- ✅ Neurodivergent-first requirement matches accessibility constraints
- ✅ 30-day revenue target aligns with user's financial urgency
- ✅ Two-tier model (open source + enterprise) validated by user selection

**Gaps Identified:**

- ❌ Original proposal missing from repo (CODEX noted this)
- ❌ No machine-readable schemas for artifacts (fixed in Phase 0)
- ❌ No CI gate description (being built)
- ❌ Keys handling not specified (needs implementation)
- ❌ Governance thresholds not parameterized (needs config)
- ❌ No market/packaging section (added in this PPP)
- ❌ No pricing proof points (needs real-world validation)

### Explore: Options Considered

#### Option 1: Full SaaS Platform (Rejected)

- Pros: Recurring revenue from day 1, cloud-hosted convenience
- Cons: 90+ days to build, requires auth/billing/multi-tenancy, violates local-first principle
- Reason rejected: Timeline too long, contradicts privacy-first value prop

#### Option 2: Fully Commercial (Rejected)

- Pros: All revenue captured, no free tier cannibalization
- Cons: No community growth, no GitHub stars, hard to prove value
- Reason rejected: Open source core drives adoption (recommended by user)

#### Option 3: Open Source Core + Enterprise Tier (SELECTED)

- Pros: Community adoption, GitHub visibility, enterprise monetization path
- Cons: Free tier might satisfy some buyers
- Reason selected: Balances adoption speed with revenue potential, user confirmed

#### Option 4: Single-Model Self-Critique Council (Rejected)

- Pros: Cheaper, simpler implementation
- Cons: Single-model bias, less robust governance
- Reason rejected: Multi-model council provides diverse perspectives (user confirmed)

#### Option 5: Voice + Visual Interface (Rejected)

- Pros: Most accessible for some neurodivergent users
- Cons: Significant new infrastructure, 6+ months timeline
- Reason rejected: Visual step-by-step builder sufficient for v1 (user confirmed)

### Analyze: Trade-offs

#### Architecture Decision: Monorepo vs Multi-Repo

- **Selected:** Monorepo with packages/core, packages/council, packages/petris, packages/api
- **Trade-off:** More complex tooling vs easier dependency management
- **Why:** Single npm ci, shared TypeScript config, easier testing
- **Risk:** Package coupling - mitigated by clear interfaces

#### Language Decision: TypeScript vs Python

- **Selected:** TypeScript for orchestrator/UI, Python for council (existing)
- **Trade-off:** Two language ecosystem vs single language simplicity
- **Why:** UPOS7VS already TypeScript, council already Python, maximize reuse
- **Risk:** Polyglot complexity - mitigated by clear API boundaries

#### Schema Decision: JSON Schema vs TypeScript Types

- **Selected:** Both - JSON Schema for runtime validation, TypeScript for compile-time safety
- **Trade-off:** Duplication vs completeness
- **Why:** JSON Schema enables CI validation, TypeScript prevents dev errors
- **Risk:** Schema drift - mitigated by codegen from JSON Schema to TypeScript

#### Revenue Decision: Seat-based vs Usage-based Pricing

- **Selected:** Seat-based ($299/month for 10-25 users)
- **Trade-off:** Predictable revenue vs scales with value
- **Why:** B2B buyers prefer predictable costs, easier to sell
- **Risk:** Large teams might resist - mitigated by volume tiers

### Solve: Path Chosen

#### Phase -1: Zero Shot Brain Bootstrap (Day 0) [REQUIRED]

Goal: create the on-disk Brain inventory in a deterministic way so every developer/agent begins from the same SSoT.

##### STEP -1.1: Create the Brain folder tree

```bash

set -euo pipefail

# From repo root

mkdir -p zero-shot/brain/{components,policies,golden-paths,troubleshooting,decisions,schemas}

```

Verify (PASS/FAIL):

```bash
set -euo pipefail

test -d zero-shot/brain/components && test -d zero-shot/brain/policies && test -d zero-shot/brain/golden-paths && test -d zero-shot/brain/troubleshooting && test -d zero-shot/brain/decisions && test -d zero-shot/brain/schemas && echo "✅ PASS: Brain folders exist" || echo "❌ FAIL: Missing Brain folders"

```

##### STEP -1.2: Create the component registry index (`_index.json`)

```bash
set -euo pipefail

node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const p='zero-shot/brain/components/_index.json'; const doc={version:'1.0.0', lastUpdated:new Date().toISOString(), components:[]}; fs.writeFileSync(p, JSON.stringify(doc,null,2)+'\\n'); console.log('Wrote',p);"

```

Verify (PASS/FAIL):

```bash
set -euo pipefail

node -e "const fs=require('fs'); const p='zero-shot/brain/components/_index.json'; const j=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(p,'utf8')); const ok=j && j.version==='1.0.0' && Array.isArray(j.components); process.exit(ok?0:1);" && echo "✅ PASS: _index.json valid" || echo "❌ FAIL: _index.json invalid"

```

##### STEP -1.3: Mirror governance schemas into the Brain

```bash
set -euo pipefail

mkdir -p zero-shot/brain/schemas/governance
cp -R schemas/governance/. zero-shot/brain/schemas/governance/

```

Verify (PASS/FAIL):

```bash
set -euo pipefail

test -f zero-shot/brain/schemas/governance/handoff.schema.json && test -f zero-shot/brain/schemas/governance/openmemory.schema.json && test -f zero-shot/brain/schemas/governance/user-profile.schema.json && echo "✅ PASS: Brain schema mirror present" || echo "❌ FAIL: Brain schema mirror missing"

```

##### STEP -1.4: Day-1 ROI checklist (Brain-first readiness)

```bash
set -euo pipefail

npm run governance:check
node -e "require('fs').accessSync('zero-shot/brain/components/_index.json'); console.log('Brain index present');"

```

Status note:

- Brain-aware validation (e.g., `npm run brain:check`) is **not implemented** yet unless explicitly added later. This phase only establishes the deterministic on-disk Brain contract.

#### Phase 0: Governance API Layer (Days 1-5) [COMPLETED]

- Retrieved: Existing governance.service.ts patterns from codebase
- Created:
  - packages/core/services/governance.service.ts with Ajv schema validation
  - packages/api/governance-routes.ts with Fastify endpoints
  - packages/api/server.ts with health checks
  - schemas/governance/*.schema.json (3 schemas)
  - CLI tool at packages/cli/governance-check.ts
- Refactored: Added JSON payloads to HANDOFF.md, openmemory.md, USER_PROFILE.md
- Why: CODEX feedback required machine-readable schemas and CI enforcement

#### Phase 1: Standalone Launch (Days 6-30) [PENDING]

- Create: Product README.md with Quick Start and Enterprise CTA (for private product repo)
- Create: Enterprise landing page at `dashboard/app/enterprise/page.tsx` (App Router)
- Create: New private product repository (separate from current repo) and migrate Phase 0 + Phase 1 assets
- Create: Launch announcement drafts (posting gated by user approval)
- Create: Enterprise trial process and CRM tracking
- Why: 30-day revenue target requires immediate market validation without forcing a public code release

#### Phase 2: LLM Council Integration (Days 31-50) [PENDING]

- Retrieve: Existing council code from ${COUNCIL_ROOT}
- Move: Into packages/council/ with monorepo structure
- Create: Council voting engine with unanimous/supermajority/majority logic
- Create: Decision types schema and test cases
- Why: Multi-model governance prevents single-point bias

#### Phase 3: Petris Visual Builder (Days 51-80) [PENDING]

- Create: React Step component with status indicators
- Create: WorkflowBuilder with progress tracking
- Create: Example workflows (add-feature, refactor, security-review)
- Create: Accessibility testing suite
- Why: Neurodivergent-first UX reduces cognitive load

#### Phase 4: Integration & Launch (Days 81-120) [PENDING]

- Create: Unified zero-shot-build-os.config.json
- Create: E2E tests covering full governance workflow
- Create: CI gates (GitHub Actions) for artifact validation
- Create: Documentation and marketing site
- Why: Complete system integration enables full value delivery

### Observe: Verification Done/Planned

# Manual screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS)
# Keyboard navigation testing (Tab, Enter, Escape)

```

### Phase 4 Verification (PLANNED)

```bash

set -euo pipefail

# E2E workflow

npm run test:e2e:zero-shot # Full governance workflow passes

# CI gates

.github/workflows/governance.yml exists

# Artifact validation runs on every PR
# Schema validation runs on every PR
# Secret scan runs on every PR

```

### Notify: Output Format Delivered

**Formats Delivered:**

1. **Code Artifacts:**
   - TypeScript services with JSDoc documentation
   - Fastify API with OpenAPI schema
   - React components with Storybook stories
   - JSON Schemas for governance artifacts

2. **Documentation:**
   - This Gold Standard PPP (comprehensive)
   - CURRENT_TASKS.md (session tracking)
   - README.md (user-facing quickstart)
   - API documentation (endpoint specs)

3. **Verification Evidence:**
   - Test output logs
   - API response samples
   - CLI execution traces
   - Schema validation results

### Synthesize: Improvements to Feed Back

#### Lessons Learned

1. **Schema-first governance works** - JSON Schema validation caught structural issues immediately
2. **CLI + API duality valuable** - Developers use CLI, CI uses API
3. **Neurodivergent design principles** - Explicit verification criteria reduce anxiety
4. **Local-first complexity** - Secrets management harder without cloud storage
5. **Honest communication critical** - User caught dishonesty, trust broken temporarily

#### Feed Forward to Future Work

1. Add schema generation from TypeScript types (reduce duplication)
2. Create visual schema editor for non-technical users
3. Build GitHub App for automatic governance checks
4. Create enterprise dashboard for team-wide visibility
5. Add automated migration scripts for version upgrades

### Risks / Edge Cases / Failure Modes

#### Risk Register

#### RK-001: Market Adoption Slower Than 30 Days

- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: High (user has $7, needs revenue)
- Mitigation: Parallel outreach to 10+ companies, HN/Reddit launch for visibility
- Contingency: Extend free trial to 60 days, offer discounted annual contracts

#### RK-002: Enterprise Buyers Demand Hosted Solution

- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: Medium (expands scope significantly)
- Mitigation: Offer "managed cloud" option at higher tier ($799/month)
- Contingency: Partner with cloud provider for white-label hosting

#### RK-003: Schema Validation Performance Issues

- Likelihood: Low
- Impact: Medium (slow CI gates)
- Mitigation: Benchmark with large artifacts, optimize Ajv compilation
- Contingency: Make schema validation optional, warn instead of fail

#### RK-004: Council Costs Too High for Users

- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: Medium (limits council usage)
- Mitigation: Support local models (Ollama), implement caching
- Contingency: Offer "lite" council with single model + roles

#### RK-005: Neurodivergent UX Not Truly Accessible

- Likelihood: Low
- Impact: High (alienates target users)
- Mitigation: User testing with neurodivergent developers, WCAG audits
- Contingency: Hire accessibility consultant, iterate based on feedback

#### RK-006: Secrets Still Leak Despite Scanning

- Likelihood: Low
- Impact: Critical (compliance violation)
- Mitigation: Git hooks for pre-commit scanning, clear error messages
- Contingency: Add secrets rotation automation, alert on detection

#### Edge Cases

1. **Artifact file too large (>10MB)** - Fail validation, suggest splitting
2. **JSON schema has circular references** - Detect and reject during load
3. **User has no internet (offline mode)** - Skip API provider calls, use local models only
4. **Multiple users editing same artifact** - Git conflicts, require merge resolution
5. **Schema version mismatch** - Show clear migration path, prevent auto-upgrades

#### Failure Modes

1. **Governance check hangs** - 30-second timeout with error message
2. **API server won't start (port conflict)** - Detect and suggest alternate port
3. **Schema load fails (malformed JSON)** - Show validation error with line number
4. **LLM Council unreachable** - Fallback to single-model decision with warning
5. **Petris UI crashes** - Error boundary with "retry" option, save state to localStorage

### A11y Notes (Focus, Keyboard, Labels, Contrast)

**Phase 0 (CLI/API) - N/A for accessibility:**

- CLI output uses emoji indicators (✅❌) with text equivalents
- API responses are JSON (consumed by tools, not humans)

**Phase 3 (Petris UI) - Planned Accessibility:**

**Focus Management:**

- All interactive elements receive visible focus ring (3px solid blue, #0066CC)
- Focus order follows visual order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
- Modal traps focus until dismissed (Escape key to close)
- Skip links provided for main content areas

**Keyboard Navigation:**

- Tab/Shift+Tab navigate between interactive elements
- Enter/Space activate buttons and links
- Escape closes modals and dismisses notifications
- Arrow keys navigate within lists and menus
- No keyboard traps (all elements reachable and escapable)

**Labels and ARIA:**

- All form inputs have associated `label` elements
- Buttons have descriptive text (not just icons)
- Status messages use aria-live="polite" for screen readers
- Progress indicators use aria-valuenow, aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax
- Icons have aria-label when used without text

**Contrast:**

- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text
- Text contrast ≥ 3:1 for large text (18px+)
- Focus indicators ≥ 3:1 contrast with background
- Status colors use patterns + color (not color alone)

**Motion:**

- Respects prefers-reduced-motion media query
- Animations disabled if motion = reduce
- Transitions ≤ 200ms for essential feedback
- No auto-playing carousels or scrolling

### Brand/Tokens Applied

### Unsupported Use Cases / Known Limitations

**Unsupported:**

1. **Windows Support** - Tested on macOS only, Windows compatibility unverified
2. **Browser-based usage** - CLI/API only, no web UI in Phase 0
3. **Multiple concurrent repos** - Governance check assumes single repo at a time
4. **Non-JSON artifacts** - Only validates artifacts with JSON fenced blocks
5. **Custom schema locations** - Schemas must be in `schemas/governance/`
6. **Real-time collaboration** - No WebSocket/multiplayer editing
7. **Offline schema validation** - Requires schemas on disk (no CDN fallback)

**Known Limitations:**

1. **Schema size** - Very large schemas (>1MB) may cause performance issues
2. **Artifact size** - Files >10MB will fail validation with size error
3. **Concurrent API requests** - No rate limiting implemented yet
4. **Error messages** - Some Ajv errors are cryptic (e.g., "/ must have required property 'X'")
5. **Port conflicts** - API server fails if port 3001 already in use
6. **TypeScript compilation** - Requires Node.js 18+ (v16 untested)

### Open Items / Follow-Ups

## PART 1: UPOS7VS Standalone Launch

## Timeline: 30 Days to First Revenue

### Phase 0: Governance API Layer (Days 1-5)

**CRITICAL:** Before public launch, UPOS7VS must expose governance APIs as specified in CODEX feedback.

#### STEP 0.0: Preflight + Environment Setup

**What:** Verify toolchain, set required variables, and ensure repo/council paths exist.

**Implementation:**

```bash
set -euo pipefail

export REPO_ROOT="${REPO_ROOT:-$(pwd)}"
export COUNCIL_ROOT="${COUNCIL_ROOT:-$HOME/dev/llm-council}"
export YOUR_ORG="${YOUR_ORG:-coreyalejandro}"
export YOUR_EMAIL="${YOUR_EMAIL:-enterprise@upos7vs.com}"

if [ -f "/Users/coreyalejandro/devs/AppleScriptUI/app-cleaner.applescript" ]; then
  osascript "/Users/coreyalejandro/devs/AppleScriptUI/app-cleaner.applescript"
fi

test -d "$REPO_ROOT" && echo "✅ Repo root: $REPO_ROOT" || (echo "❌ Missing repo root: $REPO_ROOT" && exit 1)
test -d "$COUNCIL_ROOT/backend" && echo "✅ Council backend present" || (echo "❌ Missing council backend: $COUNCIL_ROOT/backend" && exit 1)
test -d "$COUNCIL_ROOT/frontend/src/components" && echo "✅ Council UI components present" || (echo "❌ Missing council UI: $COUNCIL_ROOT/frontend/src/components" && exit 1)

node --version
npm --version
npx tsc --version
python3 --version
python3 -c "import fastapi, httpx; print('fastapi/httpx ✅')"

test -f package-lock.json && echo "✅ package-lock.json present" || (echo "❌ Missing package-lock.json" && exit 1)
npm ci
```

**How to verify (0.0):**

```bash
set -euo pipefail

test -n "$REPO_ROOT" && test -n "$COUNCIL_ROOT" && test -n "$YOUR_ORG" && echo "✅ Env vars set" || echo "❌ Missing env vars"
```

      },
      config
    );
  }

  async initialize(): Promise<void> {

    this.status.enabled = true;
  }

  async shutdown(): Promise<void> {
    this.status.initialized = false;
  }

  async healthCheck(): Promise<boolean> {
    return true;
  }

  protected shouldEnable(): boolean {
    return true; // Always enabled
  }

  async checkArtifacts(rootDir: string = process.cwd()): Promise<GovernanceStatus> {
    const artifacts: ArtifactCheck[] = [];
    const missing: string[] = [];

    for (const artifact of this.requiredArtifacts) {
      const artifactPath = path.join(rootDir, artifact);
      try {

          name: artifact,
          path: artifactPath,
          exists: false
        });
        missing.push(artifact);
      }
    }

    return {
      compliant: missing.length === 0,
      artifacts,
      missingArtifacts: missing,
      lastCheck: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  }

  async validateHandoff(filePath: string): Promise<{ valid: boolean; errors: string[] }> {
    const errors: string[] = [];

    try {
      const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');

      // Check for required sections
      const requiredSections = ['## Current State', '## Next Steps', '## Blockers'];
      for (const section of requiredSections) {
        if (!content.includes(section)) {
          errors.push(`Missing section: ${section}`);
        }
      }

      // Check freshness (must be updated within last 7 days)
      const stats = await fs.stat(filePath);
      const daysSinceUpdate = (Date.now() - stats.mtime.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
      if (daysSinceUpdate > 7) {
        errors.push(`HANDOFF.md is stale (${Math.round(daysSinceUpdate)} days old, max 7)`);
      }

      return { valid: errors.length === 0, errors };
    } catch (error) {
      return { valid: false, errors: [`Failed to read file: ${error}`] };
    }
  }
}

```

export async function registerGovernanceRoutes(
  fastify: FastifyInstance,
  governanceService: GovernanceService
) {
  // GET /api/governance/status
  fastify.get('/api/governance/status', async (request, reply) => {
    const status = await governanceService.checkArtifacts();
    return status;
  });

  // POST /api/governance/validate/handoff
  fastify.post<{ Body: { path: string } }>(
    '/api/governance/validate/handoff',
    async (request, reply) => {
      const { path } = request.body;
      const result = await governanceService.validateHandoff(path);
      return result;
    }
  );

  // GET /api/governance/health
  fastify.get('/api/governance/health', async (request, reply) => {
    const healthy = await governanceService.healthCheck();
    return { status: healthy ? 'healthy' : 'unhealthy' };
  });
}

```

✅ **UPOS7VS Core System**

- Orchestrator with multi-provider support
- Analytics dashboard (Next.js)
- Semantic mode routing
- 95%+ test coverage
- Local-first architecture
- Location: `${REPO_ROOT}`

✅ **LLM Council (80% Complete)**

- Multi-model voting via OpenRouter
- 3-stage deliberation (opinions → review → consensus)
- React frontend with tab view
- FastAPI backend
- Location: `${COUNCIL_ROOT}`

✅ **Governance Artifacts**

- HANDOFF protocol
- Testing infrastructure

## What Does Not Exist (Needs Building)

❌ **Part 1 Items:**

- Public GitHub repository (not pushed yet)
- MIT License file
- Enterprise landing page
- Revenue infrastructure

❌ **Part 2 Items:**

- Council integration into UPOS7VS monorepo
- Petris visual builder components
- Unified configuration system
- CI governance gates
- Example workflows

## Functional Status

**UPOS7VS:** ✅ **Production-Ready** (verified via tests, can be used today)

**LLM Council:** ⚠️ **Functional but Standalone** (works independently, needs integration)

**Zero-Shot-Build-OS:** ❌ **Conceptual** (this document defines the integration plan)

**Petris:** ❌ **Not Started** (component designs provided, needs implementation)

## Time Estimates Accuracy

**Conservative Estimates:**

- Part 1 (30 days): Assumes 2-4 hours/day execution time
- Part 2 (90 days): Assumes 4-6 hours/day execution time

**Aggressive Estimates:**

- Part 1: Could be done in 10-14 days full-time
- Part 2: Could be done in 30-45 days full-time

**Reality Check:**

- First revenue: Likely 45-60 days (accounts for marketing lag)
- Full system: Likely 120-150 days (accounts for iteration)

## Risk Factors

**High Risk:**

- **Market adoption** - Open source success requires community engagement
- **Enterprise sales** - B2B sales cycles often >90 days

**Medium Risk:**

- **Technical integration** - Council + UPOS7VS merge has some complexity
- **UI/UX quality** - Petris needs user testing for neurodivergent accessibility

**Low Risk:**

- **Core functionality** - UPOS7VS and Council both work independently
- **Technical feasibility** - All components proven individually

## Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate (This Week):**

1. Run STEP 1.1.1-1.1.3 to prepare repository
2. Create GitHub repository (STEP 2.1.1)
3. Push code and get first GitHub stars

**Next Week:**

1. Launch announcements (HN, Reddit, Twitter)
2. Set up enterprise email and landing page
3. Reach out to 10 companies for trials

**Month 2:**

1. Begin council integration
2. Design Petris components
3. Iterate based on early feedback
