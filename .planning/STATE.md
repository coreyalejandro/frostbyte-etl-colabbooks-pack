# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-08)

**Core value:** Every planning artifact must be so specific and deterministic that a person who has never seen the codebase could build, deploy, support, and explain the system by following the documents alone.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Product Definition and Tech Decisions

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Product Definition and Tech Decisions)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-08 — Roadmap created (8 phases, 37 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8 phases derived from 37 requirements (comprehensive depth)
- Roadmap: PRD + TECH first, then cross-cutting architecture (ISOL, AUDIT, SAFETY), then IMPL layer-by-layer, then DEPLOY, then team docs
- Roadmap: Phases 2 and 3 are parallel-capable (both depend on Phase 1 only) but sequenced for simplicity
- Research completed: STACK, FEATURES, ARCHITECTURE, PITFALLS available in .planning/research/
